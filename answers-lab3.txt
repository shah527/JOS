1. Each exception or interrupt has its own set of handler functions, which makes the kernel able to deal with different types of exceptions/interrupts containing action implementations 
specific for given exceptions or interrupts. Without individual handlers, the kernel would not be able to do actions for different situations, that execution context would be lost for exception-specific responses that don't have their own handler.

2. No, I did not. The user/softint program produces a general protection fault despite explicitly invoking int $14 because protected environments 
restrict software interrupts to those explicitly permitted by the kernel (no direct user access to specific interrupts). Allowing int $14 to directly call the page fault handler without proper authorization would compromise system integrity by exposing kernel functionality to user mode.
